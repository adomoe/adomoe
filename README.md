### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A little about me:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently upskilling by completing the Applied Data Science program through MIT Professional and Executive Learning.*
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me apply my basic DS/ML skills ("use it or lose it"). Team projects +++
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with preparing for transition into a DS-focused role.
